# Haus

### Description
*Haus* is the aggregation of many smaller apps that together can be used by a household to organise and coordinate together.
The beauty of this app is it's extensible nature.

### TODO - Apps
- shopping list
- scheduler (calendar for each user of an account so anyone can see what everyone is doing at a glance)
- to-do list (intended for household todo's, wash the dishes, hang out laundry, etc.)

###### maybes / do laters
- chat (eventually a chat function within a household and within the app would be perfect, no more whatsapp house groups needed)
- finance manager (something to manage money-in vs money-out, or maybe just something to track shared bills ?)
